# Code-a-COVID-Density-Display-With-MapBox
MapBox is an American provider of custom online maps for websites and apps, combining slick stylization with robust data processing to supercharge visual representation of location data.  It’s used by Foursquare, Lonely Planet, The Financial Times, The Weather Channel, Snapchat, and many others, with a vast array of niche customization that isn’t found in other providers like Google Maps - the company is currently valued at over $1 billion.  In this session, we’ll show you how to get started with the MapBox API.  We’ll take spreadsheet data on COVID cases and transform it into JSON to bring it into JavaScript where we’ll use the API to display COVID density for individual regions with color-coded markers on a custom world map.  

Prerequisites:
